I am currently studying a bachelor of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Adelaide. I have also spent the last 2+ years working for Santos as an undergraduate Data Scientist, focusing on the application of predictive analytics to key assets.

My career aspirations for the future are to gain employment as a full time data scientist, and continue to develop expertise in this field. My focus for the next year is to finish my degree, and to develop a deep understanding of software engineering best practices.
